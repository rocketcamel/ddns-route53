# Getting Started

A simple, lightweight Dynamic DNS (DDNS) updater using AWS Route53.  
This tool enables automatic DNS record updates when your public IP changes â€” ideal for home servers or dynamic IP setups.

## Features

- Automatically detects your current public IP address
- Updates Route53 DNS A record(s) to point to your current IP
- Simple configuration with the `setup` command
- Installs a systemd service on supported machines for continuous updates

## Prerequisites

- AWS credentials with permissions to modify Route53 records
- A registered domain with a hosted zone in AWS Route53

## Installation

You can install from the [latest release](https://github.com/rocketcamel/ddns-route53/releases/latest
)

or using `cargo`

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/rocketcamel/ddns-route53.git
```

## Usage
> [!WARNING]
> This program needs to be run as root to function correctly by default, since it uses systemd and is ran as the root user in the service. You can create your own timer or cron running at user level if this is not possible.

You need to have the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` environment variables set.
using `aws configure` or setting these manually is sufficient

- `ddns-route53 setup` will interactively generate a config, and if possible create systemd timers.
- `ddns-route53 update` will get your current IP, and update the configured record
- `ddns-route53 add` adds a new A record to point to your public IP address
- `ddns-route53 remove` removes record(s) from the configuration (optionally remove from route53)
- `ddns-route53 list` list configured records that will be updated
